# **SCHOOL - Project**

## **DESCRIPTION**  
The **AbstractVM** project involves building a virtual machine that operates on a **stack-based architecture**. This virtual machine processes instructions to perform arithmetic and logical operations on values of different types, including integers (`int8`, `int16`, `int32`) and floating-point numbers (`float`, `double`).  

The program reads instructions from a file or standard input, executes them, and displays the results.

## **FEATURES**  
- **Stack manipulation:**  
  - Push and pop values on/from the stack.  
- **Arithmetic operations:**  
  - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.  
- **Type handling:**  
  - Support for `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `float`, and `double` types.  
- **Logical operations:**  
  - Assert values and compare stack elements.  
- **Input/Output:**  
  - Instructions can be provided through a file or standard input.  
  - Results and errors are displayed on the standard output.

## **FUNCTIONS ALLOWED**  
- **C++ standard library functions**  
- **Input/Output:**  
  - `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`.
